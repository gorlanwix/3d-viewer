## 3D Viewer

The 3D Viewer Wix app allows site creators to upload their 3D models to an environment configurable through the settings panel. 

Lighting, shading, colors, and background are controlled by the site owner. Site visitors will only be able to view the model and change perspectives. This way, site owners can display their work as intended.
